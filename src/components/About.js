            <p>
                Lingo Grow is an app that impplements two API's to pull iformation on any given word the user would like to know more aoubt. The idea is to both grow the vocabulary , as well as comprehension with street sland and urban usage. The app is not yet complete so for now, there is some lore ipsum down below to fill this about with data.

                The Development Process

            <p>
            This past week I was given the assignment to build a React app using Redux. The requirements were simple but relevant. This was a tremendous opportunity to display my knowledge of the past three weeks of learning we did here at DigitalCrafts bootcamp. Looking back on the four days I was given to create this project, I feel my time/assets could have been better managed at the start. The first day I spent researching potential builds, weighing in the scope, production time, and over all applicability to demo the technologies I recently learned. The second I spent building out a project that was doomed to fail. I bit off more than I could chew and got lost in the sauce of styling before my functionality was complete. The third and fourth day I spent creating two separate apps. They essentially did very similar things, had an API, CRUD, implemented Redux and met the requirements we were given.
One of the lessons I can take away from this week of development, is that initial planning is worth itâ€™s weight in gold. So much wasted effort went into creating a poorly planned out project, and too much time was wasted on styling before the project had even taken off. Admittedly, I was too presumptuous with my time and ability to handle blockers that came up. In the future, I will be more diligent with managing my allotted resources. Perhaps there is merit in the adage to under-promise and over-deliver.
I look forward to continuing development on all the projects I started this week.Going forward my focus will be narrowed and better thought out.
